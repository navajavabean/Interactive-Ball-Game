#### **Code Highlights**
1. **Ball Movement and Animation:**
   - Implemented using `AnimationTimer` to update the ball's position in real time.
   
2. **Collision Detection:**
   - Uses the `contains()` method to detect if the mouse click intersects the ball.

3. **Dynamic Difficulty:**
   - Ball speed and size dynamically adjust based on the player's performance.

4. **UI Design:**
   - Buttons (`Pause`, `Reset`) and real-time text updates (`Hits`, `Misses`) enhance gameplay interactivity.
   - Layout created using `BorderPane`, `Pane`, and `HBox`.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Framework:** JavaFX
- **Animation:** `AnimationTimer`
- **Event Handling:** Mouse and Button click events

---

#### **Future Improvements**
- Add multiple difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- Introduce sound effects for clicks and game over.
- Track and display the highest score across sessions.
